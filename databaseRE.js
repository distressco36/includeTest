      description: "Own a piece of history in the heart of the historic district! Situated on one of the oldest and most photographed streets of Charleston, 24 Chalmers is southern charm at its finest. The expansive home, at just over 6,100 square feet, is located on one of the highest points in the City and is currently zoned for up to three units with an array of possible configurations. The double front porches are perfect for relaxing and entertaining guests. The massive windows and high ceilings throughout offer incredible views of the cityscape and allow plenty of natural light into the airy space. Multiple fireplaces, staircases, window and door casings and brickwork all point to the past. The building has served as a church and carpenter's warehouse before its long tenure as a residential *more* structure. <br><br>After sustaining damage in the earthquake of 1886, the original brick and slate roof construction was transformed. Evidence of this can still be observed in the sturdy foundation. <br><br>The home is nestled on a cobblestone street draped with crepe myrtles steps from everything Charleston has to offer. The shady canopy of Washington Square Park is less than a block away. King Street, Broad Street, Meeting Street, Market Street and East Bay Street surround the property. Walk to some of the most admired restaurants and shops in the country. The premiere location and its rich history makes 24 Chalmers a rare opportunity to own a piece of history in the center of our nation's most beloved city."
